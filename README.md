# Appium Testing for (PSUT) Android Studio Phone Eimulator

This repository contains automated tests using Appium to validate number inputs on the PSUT simulator via Android Studio. The tests cover three scenarios: validating all numbers, even numbers, and odd numbers.

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Verify All Numbers
- Validate the input field's acceptance of various numerical inputs, including positive integers, negative integers, and floating-point numbers.

### Test Case 2: Verify Even Numbers
- Confirm the application's capability to recognize and accept only even numbers.
- Ensure rejection of odd numbers and other non-numeric characters.

### Test Case 3: Verify Odd Numbers
- Validate the application's ability to recognize and accept only odd numbers.
- Ensure rejection of even numbers and other non-numeric characters.
